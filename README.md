This is a simple QR code component that allows users to scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and enhance their front-end development skills. The project was built using HTML and CSS and is fully responsive, adapting to both mobile and desktop views. This challenge helped me improve my ability to create clean, efficient layouts while adhering to design specifications.
